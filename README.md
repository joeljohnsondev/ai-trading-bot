# AI Trading Bot
This repository contains a AI based trading bot for Ethereum based tokens for decentralized exchanges.

## Setup Steps
Access [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org) and [MetaMask](https://metamask.io).<br/>
Create a **New File** on Remix. Rename it whatever you want, or: **bot.sol**<br/>
Paste the bot.sol source code from this repository into the file you just created.<br/>
Go to the **Compile** tab on Remix and Compile with Solidity version 0.6.6<br/>
Go to the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab on Remix, select the **Injected Provider** environment, then **Deploy**. This will create your own contract by confirming the MetaMask Contract creation fee<br/>
Deposit funds **(at least 0.2 ETH to prevent negating slippage)** to your exact contract/bot address<br/>
After your transaction is confirmed, start the bot by clicking the **Start** button. Withdraw anytime by clicking **Withdrawal**. Wait about a day for best profit potential.<br/>
